## Description

The HTTP `226 IM Used` response status, in the context of delta encodings, is a status code set by the server to indicate that it is returning a delta to the GET request that it received. IM stands for _Instance Manipulations_, the term used to describe an algorithm generating a delta.

With delta encoding a server responds to `GET` requests with differences (called deltas) relative to a given base document (rather than the current document). The client uses the `A-IM:` HTTP header to indicate which differencing algorithm to use and the `If-None-Match:` header to hint the server about the last version it got. The server generates a delta, sending it back in an HTTP response with the `226` status code and containing the `IM:` (with the name of the algorithm used) and `Delta-Base:` (with the `ETag` matching the base document associated to the delta) HTTP headers.

<aside class="info"><strong>Note:</strong> Browsers don't support delta encoding with HTTP. This status code is sent back by custom servers used by specific clients.</aside>
