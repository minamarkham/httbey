## Description

The HTTP `208 Already Reported` response status is used in a [207 Multi-Status](https://http.cat/status/207) response to save space and avoid conflicts. If the same resource is requested several times (for example as part of a collection), with different paths, only the first one is reported with [200](https://http.cat/status/200). Responses for all other bindings will report with this 208 status code, so no conflicts are created and the response stays shorter.

<aside class="info"><strong>Note:</strong>The ability to bind a resource to several paths is an extension to the WebDAV protocol (it may be received by web applications accessing a WebDAV server). Browsers accessing web pages will never encounter this status code.</aside>
