## Development

This project requires Node v18+ to build. (Consider using a version manager like [nvm][1] to easily switch node versions!). As of v2.0.0 it's built with Next.js 13.

Run `npm install` to pull in dependencies and then `npm run dev`. The app should build, run, and be available at [localhost:3000][2].
